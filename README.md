# Hello, I'm Ray!

From a mechanical engineering graduate to a web developer! Currently learning Vue, React, and NextJS as a framework. Fascinated by cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science.

When I'm not working, I read a lot of light novels and manga/manwha. Sometimes, I'll go to a coffee shop with my laptop to explore new technologies.
