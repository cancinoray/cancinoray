# Hello, I'm Ray!

Mechanical Engineer | Web Developer | Data Enthusiast

Hi there! Iâ€™m a mechanical engineering graduate who ventured into web development and discovered a passion for data science along the way. For nearly two years, Iâ€™ve been building websites and applications using frameworks like Vue, React, and Next.js, making projects smoother and more efficient.

These days, Iâ€™m diving deeper into data science, machine learning fundamentals and data engineeringâ€”learning how to create and maintain data pipeline, build, evaluate, and deploy models, as well as discovering new ways to bring data insights into development. I love how data combines engineering and analytics to solve real-world problems, and Iâ€™m excited about how these skills can enhance my work even more.

Outside of coding, youâ€™ll usually find me with a light novel, manga, or manhwa, or enjoying coffee shop vibes while exploring the latest in tech.

Letâ€™s connect if you're into data, development, or just want to chat about new tech trends!
